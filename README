Herding Cats (Tentative Title)

Initial: 
You must feed a party of 10 hungry, conflict-averse, indecisive friends.
-Along the way: pick up people, lose people
-If you fight, you lose
-If everyone starves, you lose
-If time runs out, all restaurants near convention center close

5/23/2014:
-People say they'll arrive at one time, come late
-People bring in other people, or ask to stop because they get a call from
another person
-Like the Oregon Trail for people who defer to others too much
-Secret food preferences no one will share
-Take a vote: "I dunno, I'll just eat whatever the group decides"
-Math.random to set friend preferences, hunger levels
-Call in a reservation but the friend count must be exact when you arrive
-Exhaustion level -- people will only walk so far before they give up and go
back to the hotel

5/24/2014:
XRandom restaurant rolls?
-Check your phone, show the next couple restaurants ahead

5/26/2014
XRestuarant Map Maker -- pulls random restaurants from the restaurant pool to
build a town ($restaurants)

5/27/2014
	XCurrent Errors in Town Generator
	XCan pull 15 (undefined)
	X	Can always pull one past the length (e.g. 13 after 2 have been removed)
	X	Subtract one from the random draw? 
	XCan double restaurants
	XSome restaurant draws return blanks? 
-Multiple directions to walk from convention center, Town Generator to roll up in
	2 (3?) directions, so the player + party can backtrack
-The ability to burn a turn checking a cellphone to get an idea of what's around
-Price as a factor for higher quality places -- thriftiness/money stat? 
-TITLE: But Only If That's Okay With Everybody Else
-TITLE: I'll Eat Whatever
-Add .desc to each object for personalized description
-Add a unique graphic for each restaurant
-Multiplayer Mode: 
	-Up to 16 diners can be in the group
	-You get more points if your secret preference is where you eat
	-You lose more points if your secret hate is where you eat
	-Cooperative score
	-No speaking away from game
	-Dialogue options are all Midwestern nonsense "Hrm." "I guess that's
fine." "Okay." All things you could read both ways
	-Wait too long, everyone starves
	-Multi-day convention mode, too much low-quality food, exasperation
higher
	-Exasperation stat, you can up it to gain more power, but too high,
everybody fights, nobody wins

[[Some Data Loss Here]]

6/6/2014
-Problems pulling objects on work computer, had to update Twine but lost some
data in this file. Otherwise everything seems to work.
-Taste spectrum in friend objects? An array of possible restaurants a friend
might like, then a random pull to set their preference this time? 

6/16/2014
Added the option to put in names when there's a wait.
xWait should show up in the description somehow. 
-Add a min/max wait time to each restaurant? 
-Intangibles deck to draw after a place is picked -- bad waiter, late food,
wrong bill, etc.
-Guy Fieri style chain takes over places in subsequent days, slowly homogenizing
them all
-Started work on phone
-Create a passage that just provides group status inforamtion and the rare
opportunity for $friends to volunteer information. Run it at each restaurant,
score check, wait check, phone check, etc. Other events could happen here as
well
If there is a wait, actively require the player to push a WAIT action each turn
after names are put in. This way you can gain/lose people and change your mind.


6/19/2014
-Option to tweet your final score screen. "We went out for X, Y friends died
along the way, but I scored Z points." #LetsGoEat

6/23/2014
-Weather? 
XCreate a routine to run at the end of each turn. Increments hunger, time, etc.
-Waits that shrink the closer places get to close?
-Variable close times
XCreate variable hunger levels

6/24/2014
-Create a random preference/hate puller
XRandom Friend Group builder
	XProblem: After 6 passes, Friend Pick number starts becoming negative,
can't pick more than 6 friends.RESOLVED
-Add some text at the beginning that lists the friends coming to dinner with
you. 
-$tellerfriend now cycles each turn.
-Friends can now starve to death.
-Tombstones? Oregon Trail style? Need a $friends[$i].graveloc, and
$friends[$i].gravemsg
-Started basic code for friends leaving. What if you have multiple people who
die/want to leave at the same time? 

6/25/2014
-Started restaurant art
-If there's Twitter posting, add a screenshot of final screen.
-Build the Intangibles from 4 parts, using and/but. "You have a really great
conversation, but the music is really loud, the place is crowded, the food came
out cold and the waiter left mid-shift."
-Let players name starting friend group?
-Create an array of variables that will allow numbers 1-9 to display as text
instead of numbers.
-Redoing the intangibles to consider restaurant quality
-Disaster deck? Option for restaurant to catch on fire, open sewage, glass in
the food, etc.
-Redo "needs food badly" to pull the names, append 'and' then add the "need food
badly"?
