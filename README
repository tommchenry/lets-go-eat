Herding Cats (Tentative Title)

Initial: 
You must feed a party of 10 hungry, conflict-averse, indecisive friends.
-Along the way: pick up people, lose people
-If you fight, you lose
-If everyone starves, you lose
-If time runs out, all restaurants near convention center close

5/23/2014:
-People say they'll arrive at one time, come late
-People bring in other people, or ask to stop because they get a call from
another person
-Like the Oregon Trail for people who defer to others too much
-Secret food preferences no one will share
-Take a vote: "I dunno, I'll just eat whatever the group decides"
-Math.random to set friend preferences, hunger levels
